Invariant protocol is an AMM built on [Alephium](https://alephium.org/), leveraging high capital efficiency and the ability to list markets in a permissionless manner. At the core of the DEX is the Concentrated Liquidity mechanism, designed to handle tokens compatible with the [Fungible Token Standard](https://docs.alephium.org/tokens/fungible-tokens).
